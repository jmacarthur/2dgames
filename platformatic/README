Platformatic 2D, a demo Puzzle/Platform game. 

You will need Python (I tested with 2.7; other versions may work) and PyGame 
(http://pygame.org/) and Perl.

If those are installed, run "./levelconverter.pl" then "python main.py" to start. 

This is intended as a demonstration, or a starting point for other
developments, not a full game. I don't believe level four can be completed, but it may be possible.
