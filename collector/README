Object Collector 2D, a demonstration of PyGame as a platform game. 

You will need Python (I tested with 2.7; other versions may work) and PyGame 
(http://pygame.org/).

If those are installed, run "python collector.py" to start. 

This is intended as a demonstration, or a starting point for other
developments, not a full game. The second level cannot be completed (as there
is no level 3).
